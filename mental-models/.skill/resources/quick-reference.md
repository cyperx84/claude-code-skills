## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Start with General models** (m01-m09) for any situation
2. **Match category to domain**: Systems models for tech, Economics for business, Human Nature for teams
3. **Combine 2-3 models** for richer analysis (latticework approach)
4. **Follow the Thinking Steps** - that's where the value is
5. **Use Coaching Questions** to go deeper
6. **Check "When to Avoid"** before applying
7. **Quick-apply for speed**, deep-analysis for important decisions
