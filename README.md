# Claude Code Skills Collection

A curated collection of Claude Code skills designed to enhance your workflow with structured thinking frameworks, cognitive tools, and domain expertise.

## Overview

This repository contains production-ready Claude Code skills that you can use to augment your development workflow, decision-making, and problem-solving capabilities. Each skill is battle-tested, well-documented, and includes comprehensive examples.

## Available Skills

### ðŸ§  Mental Models (v1.0.0)

Apply Charlie Munger's "latticework of mental models" to any problem using 98 cognitive frameworks from multiple disciplines.

**What it does**:
- **Quick-Apply Mode** (1-2 min): Instantly apply a specific model to your current context
- **Deep-Analysis Mode** (10-15 min): Comprehensive multi-model analysis with full synthesis
- **Discovery Mode** (30 sec): Search and browse 98 models by keywords
- **Interactive Mode** (2-3 min): Guided model selection through Q&A

**Use cases**:
- Code architecture decisions
- Product strategy and prioritization
- Career and personal decisions
- Team dynamics and management
- Bias detection and risk assessment

## Quick Start

### Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyperx84/claude-code-skills.git
cd claude-code-skills
```

### Using a Skill

#### Option 1: Local (Project-Specific)

Use skills directly from the repository when working in this directory. Claude Code will automatically detect skills in `.skill/` directories.

```bash
cd mental-models
# Skill is now available in this context
```

#### Option 2: Global Installation

Make a skill available across all projects by symlinking to your global Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
# Install mental-models globally
ln -s $(pwd)/mental-models/.skill ~/.claude/skills/mental-models

# Or copy instead of symlink
cp -r mental-models/.skill ~/.claude/skills/mental-models
```

### Example Usage

```
# Mental Models skill
"Apply bottlenecks model to our CI/CD pipeline"

"/mental-models - Should I accept this job offer?"

"What mental models help with scaling systems?"
```
